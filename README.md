E-Commerce Management API

Welcome to the E-Commerce Management API! This program serves as a backend system for managing various aspects of an e-commerce platform, including customers, products, orders, and customer accounts. It's designed to provide a seamless experience for developers looking to integrate e-commerce functionalities into their applications.

How It Works
The E-Commerce Management API operates on a RESTful architecture, meaning it communicates via standard HTTP requests. It utilizes the Flask framework, a popular choice for building web applications in Python. Here's a breakdown of its key components and functionalities:

Customers: The API allows you to add, retrieve, update, and delete customer information. This includes details such as name, email, and phone number.

Customer Accounts: Customers can have associated accounts for authentication. This feature enables the creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of customer accounts, managing their usernames and passwords.

Products: You can manage product information through the API, including adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting products. Each product has a name and a price.

Orders: Customers can place orders for products. The API facilitates order creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion. Orders are associated with customers and contain information about the purchased products and order date.

Using Postman

Postman is a valuable tool for testing and debugging APIs, including the E-Commerce Management API. Developers can use Postman to send requests to API endpoints, inspect the responses, and verify the functionality of different API operations. By simulating various scenarios and interactions, Postman helps ensure that the API functions as expected and meets the project requirements. Additionally, Postman's collection feature allows developers to organize and share API requests, facilitating collaboration and streamlining the testing process.
